# Aseprite Script
This repository is my workspace for developing LUA scripts and extensions for [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

## NxPA Studio
A script suite/extension for [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) that adds image processing functionalities.

Contains:
* **NxScale / Advanced Scaling** - allows for upscaling pixel art without introducing new colors using a variety of algorithms: Nearest Neighbor, Eagle, Scale2x, Scale3x and a custom algorithm named Hawk.

* **NxTween / Add Inbetween Frames** - adds in between frames based on position.

## On-Screen Controls
An extension that adds On-Screen Controls for touch screen users.

## AsepriteOS
An experimental project trying to implements basic applications as [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) scripts/extensions.

Contains:
* **Note** - a to-do list app inside Aseprite.

# How add Scripts to Aseprite
In order to add LUA scripts open Aseprite and select _File_ > _Scripts_ > _Open Scripts Folder_. Next, copy script files to the opened directory.
